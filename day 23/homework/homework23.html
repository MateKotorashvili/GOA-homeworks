    <h3>Cascading Style Sheets</h3> (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and 
    styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, 
    MathML or XHTML).
    CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside <b><i>HTML and JavaScript.</i></b>
    <h5>
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
        This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility 
        and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; 
        enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, 
        which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .
        css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
